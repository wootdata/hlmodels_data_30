Installation:

Instert the .mdl and .bmp into valve\models\player\AvP2Pred

Credits:
The model came from Alines Vs. Predator 2.  The sounds came from the original Alins Vs. Predator.  I put it all together in a way HL can use.

Notes:
You can't hear your own sounds unless you use third person mode.  You can always hear other people using the model.
